{"question": "An explorer is challenging to pass through a maze composed of 3033 rows and 3032 columns of squares. The rules of the maze are as follows: In all the middle rows (that is, from the 2nd row to the 3032nd row), there is one invisible teleportation gate hidden in each row, and there are no multiple invisible teleportation gates in the same column. The explorer starts from any position in the 1st row. Each time, he can move one square up, down, left or right, and it is allowed to pass through the explored areas repeatedly. If the explorer touches a teleportation gate, he will immediately return to the starting point and start the next attempt. However, the explorer will mark the position of that teleportation gate. If the explorer reaches any position in the 3033rd row, he will directly pass the maze. It is known that the explorer can remember the positions of all the discovered teleportation gates.
